# Futures Trading Hardening - Complete ✅

## What Was Built

### 1. Idempotent Orders ✅
**File**: `backend/backend/core/futures/order_ids.py`
- Deterministic `client_order_id` using BLAKE3 hash
- Prevents duplicate orders from retries
- Same order params = same ID = safe retry

**Usage**:
```python
from core.futures.order_ids import client_order_id
oid = client_order_id({"symbol": "MESZ5", "side": "BUY", "quantity": 1})
# Returns: "RR<24-char-hash>"
```

### 2. Order State Machine ✅
**File**: `backend/backend/core/futures/state.py`
- Clean state transitions: NEW → SUBMITTED → FILLED/CANCELED/REJECTED
- Validates transitions to prevent invalid states
- Tracks transition history

**States**:
- `NEW` - Order created
- `SUBMITTED` - Sent to exchange/adapter
- `PARTIAL` - Partially filled
- `FILLED` - Fully executed
- `CANCELED` - User cancelled
- `REJECTED` - Exchange/adapter rejected
- `EXPIRED` - Order expired

### 3. IBKR Auto-Reconnect ✅
**File**: `backend/backend/core/ibkr_adapter.py`
- Auto-retry with exponential backoff (up to 10 attempts)
- Heartbeat monitoring (30s interval)
- Auto-reconnect on stale heartbeat
- Connection state management

**Features**:
- `ensure_connected()` - Checks and reconnects if needed
- Heartbeat tracking prevents silent disconnects
- Graceful fallback to paper trading

### 4. "Why Not" Policy Messages ✅
**File**: `backend/backend/core/futures/why_not.py`
- Structured rejection responses
- Clear explanations + fix suggestions
- User-friendly error messages

**Response Format**:
```python
{
  "blocked": true,
  "reason": "Max loss $120.00 exceeds limit $95.50 per trade.",
  "fix": "Reduce size to $95.50 or less.",
  "current_value": 120.0,
  "max_allowed": 95.50
}
```

### 5. Dynamic Guardrails ✅
**File**: `backend/backend/core/futures_policy.py`
- Dynamic max loss: `min($100, 0.5% of equity)`
- Volatility adjustment: tighter limits in high VIX
- Context-aware policy enforcement

**Formula**:
```
base = min($100, 0.5% * equity)
vol_adjustment = max(0.5, 1.5 - 5*volatility)
max_loss = base * vol_adjustment
```

### 6. Realistic Slippage Simulation ✅
**File**: `backend/backend/core/futures/slippage.py`
- Market orders: slippage based on spread
- Limit orders: fill at limit if favorable
- Size & liquidity adjustments
- Simulated bid/ask quotes

**Features**:
- Spread-based slippage (25% baseline)
- Volume factor (higher volume = less slippage)
- Size factor (larger orders = more slippage)
- Random variation for realism

### 7. Frontend "Why Not" Display ✅
**Files**: 
- `mobile/src/features/futures/screens/TomorrowScreen.tsx`
- `mobile/src/features/futures/services/FuturesService.ts`

- Shows blocked orders with clear explanations
- Displays fix suggestions
- Handles duplicate order messages

## Integration Status

### Backend ✅
All modules integrated:
- `futures_api.py` - Uses all new features
- `futures_policy.py` - Returns WhyNotResponse
- `ibkr_adapter.py` - Auto-reconnect ready
- `futures_service.py` - Tracks order IDs

### Frontend ✅
- Displays "why not" messages when blocked
- Shows duplicate order alerts
- Handles all new response fields

## API Changes

### Order Response (Enhanced)
```json
{
  "order_id": "RRabc123...",
  "status": "blocked" | "filled" | "duplicate",
  "message": "Order blocked by policy",
  "client_order_id": "RRabc123...",
  "why_not": {
    "blocked": true,
    "reason": "...",
    "fix": "...",
    "current_value": 120.0,
    "max_allowed": 95.50
  }
}
```

## Next Steps (When Ready)

### Shadow Mode
- Run IBKR in parallel with paper
- Log differences in decisions
- Compare outcomes

### Options Chains Precomputation
- Precompute hot chains → Redis
- Serve deltas instantly
- Update every 30-60s

### Exchange Calendar
- Block out-of-session orders
- Respect Globex overnight hours
- Warn on holidays

### Audit Trail
- Signed append-only log
- Replay any decision
- Compliance-ready

## Testing Checklist

- ✅ Idempotent order IDs (same order = same ID)
- ✅ State machine transitions (no invalid states)
- ✅ Duplicate order detection
- ✅ "Why not" messages displayed correctly
- ✅ Dynamic guardrails adjust properly
- ✅ Slippage simulation realistic
- ✅ IBKR reconnect works (simulated)
- ✅ Frontend handles all response types

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal**: All changes are additive
- **No breaking changes**: Backward compatible
- **Faster feedback**: Users get immediate "why not" explanations
- **Safer**: Idempotency prevents duplicate orders

## Status

**✅ ALL QUICK WINS COMPLETE**

The system is now:
- More robust (idempotent, state machine)
- More user-friendly (why-not messages)
- More realistic (better slippage)
- More reliable (auto-reconnect)
- Smarter (dynamic guardrails)

Ready for production use (paper trading) and IBKR integration.
