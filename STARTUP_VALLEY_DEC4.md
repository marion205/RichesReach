## 🎤 Pitch Structure (5-7 Minutes)

Since it's a smaller group, you may get more time. Prepare for both:

### 5-Minute Version (If Tight)
1. **Hook** (30 sec) - "Everyone has a trading app, but nobody has a guide..."
2. **Live Demo** (3 min) - Voice query + portfolio insight
3. **Tech Proof** (1 min) - "80+ screens, live integration, ML scoring"
4. **Ask** (30 sec) - "Looking for investors and distribution partners"

### 7-Minute Version (If You Have Time)
1. **Hook** (45 sec)
2. **Problem Deep Dive** (1 min)
3. **Live Demo** (3.5 min) - Voice + portfolio + maybe tutor
4. **Tech + Traction** (1.5 min)
5. **Business Model** (30 sec)
6. **Ask** (30 sec)

---

## 📱 Demo Flows (Pick 2-3)

### Flow 1: Voice Query (MUST SHOW)
**Say:** "Hey Riches, what should I buy for the next few weeks with about five hundred dollars?"

**Show:**
- Mic button tap
- AI processing
- Recommendations appearing
- Tap into one recommendation
- Show explanation (why, timeframe, risk)

**Time:** 90 seconds

### Flow 2: Portfolio Insight (STRONG)
**Say:** "This is your entire financial orbit in one view"

**Show:**
- Portfolio/home screen
- Tap into holding (AAPL or TSLA)
- Show risk insight
- Show actionable recommendation

**Time:** 60 seconds

### Flow 3: Education/Tutor (IF TIME)
**Say:** "Explain why TSLA is risky for a beginner in plain English"

**Show:**
- Tutor/Ask screen
- AI explanation appearing
- Plain English breakdown

**Time:** 60 seconds

---

## 🎯 Networking Strategy (Small Group Advantage)

### Before Pitches (6:30-8:00 PM)
- **Arrive early** - catch people as they arrive
- **1-on-1 demos** - smaller group = more personal
- **Listen first** - find out what they're looking for
- **Exchange cards** with everyone

### During Your Pitch
- **Make eye contact** - it's intimate, use that
- **Pause for questions** - they can interrupt (good sign!)
- **Show enthusiasm** - smaller group = more energy needed

### After Pitches
- **Deep conversations** - follow up on questions
- **Get specific feedback** - "What resonated? What didn't?"
- **Schedule follow-ups** - easier in small group

---

## 💬 Elevator Pitch (30 Seconds)

**Practice this:**
> "RichesReach is a voice-first AI trading coach. Instead of navigating complex apps, users just ask 'Hey Riches, what should I buy?' and get ML-powered recommendations with plain English explanations. We have 80+ screens built, live broker integration, and we're looking for investors to scale."

## 🎤 Full Pitch Script (5 Minutes)

### [0:00-0:30] Hook
> "Everyone has a trading app, but nobody has a guide they trust. You open six screens, ten charts, twenty TikToks, and still ask: 'What should I do today?'"
> 
> "RichesReach is a voice-first AI that actually works with your real brokerage and your real life."

### [0:30-3:30] Live Demo

**Voice Flow (90 sec):**
> "Watch this. I'll ask it what to do with $500 for the next few weeks."
> 
> [Tap mic] "Hey Riches, what should I buy for the next few weeks with about five hundred dollars?"
> 
> [Show results] "It comes back with ML-ranked candidates, each with a plain English explanation. If I like this one, I can execute via Alpaca right here."

**Portfolio Flow (90 sec):**
> "This is your entire financial orbit in one view."
> 
> [Tap into holding] "Not just a chart, but what you should do next. It tells me I'm overexposed here, or this fits my risk profile."

### [3:30-4:30] Technical Proof
> "We've built 80+ production screens, live Alpaca integration, ML scoring across 150+ tickers. Voice queries answer in under a second. This isn't a prototype — it's production-ready."

### [4:30-5:00] Ask
> "We're looking for investors and distribution partners to scale to thousands of users and formalize our compliance stack. If you're interested in seeing more, let's connect after."
