# 🔧 Advanced Analysis Fix - IP Address Configuration

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

The "Advanced Analysis" button wasn't working because the mobile app was trying to connect to the **wrong IP address**:

- **App was trying to connect to**: `172.16.225.107:8000` (old IP)
- **Django server running on**: `192.168.1.236:8000` (current IP)

This caused all GraphQL requests (including Advanced Analysis) to fail silently.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Issue 1: Missing Environment Variable**
- **File**: `mobile/env.local`
- **Problem**: Missing `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` variable
- **Code was looking for**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
- **File only had**: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`

### **Issue 2: Hardcoded Fallback IP**
- **File**: `mobile/config/api.ts`
- **Problem**: Hardcoded fallback to old IP `172.16.225.107:8000`
- **Should be**: `192.168.1.236:8000`

---

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **Fix 1: Added Missing Environment Variable**
```bash
# mobile/env.local
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.236:8000  # ← ADDED
```

### **Fix 2: Updated Fallback IP Address**
```typescript
// mobile/config/api.ts
const devHost = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE
  ?? "http://192.168.1.236:8000"; // ← UPDATED from 172.16.225.107
```

### **Fix 3: Restarted Expo Server**
- Killed old Expo process
- Started fresh with `npx expo start --clear`
- This ensures new environment variables are loaded
