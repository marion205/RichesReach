Stocks represent ownership shares in a company. When you buy a stock, you own a small piece of that company!

**Key Concepts:**
‚Ä¢ **Share Price**: What you pay for one share
‚Ä¢ **Market Cap**: Total value of all shares (Price √ó Shares Outstanding)
‚Ä¢ **Dividends**: Company profits paid to shareholders
‚Ä¢ **Bull Market**: Prices going up üìà
‚Ä¢ **Bear Market**: Prices going down üìâ

**How to Get Started:**
1. **Open a Brokerage Account** (Robinhood, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade)
2. **Start Small** - Begin with $100-500
3. **Research Companies** - Understand what you're buying
4. **Diversify** - Don't put all money in one stock

**Real Example:**
AAPL stock at $150:
- Buy 10 shares = $1,500 investment
- If AAPL goes to $160: You make $100 profit
- If AAPL drops to $140: You lose $100

**Pro Tips:**
‚úÖ Start with index funds (SPY, QQQ) for safety
‚úÖ Never invest money you can't afford to lose

Cryptocurrency is digital money that uses blockchain technology. It's decentralized, meaning no bank controls it!

**Popular Cryptocurrencies:**
‚Ä¢ **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Digital gold, store of value
‚Ä¢ **Ethereum (ETH)**: Smart contracts platform
‚Ä¢ **Cardano (ADA)**: Academic approach to blockchain
‚Ä¢ **Solana (SOL)**: Fast, low-cost transactions

**How Crypto Trading Works:**
1. **Buy on Exchanges** (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken)
2. **Store in Wallets** (Hardware wallets for security)
3. **Trade Pairs** (BTC/USD, ETH/BTC)
4. **HODL or Trade** - Long-term hold vs active trading

**Crypto vs Stocks:**
üìä **Stocks**: Regulated, company ownership, dividends
‚Çø **Crypto**: 24/7 trading, high volatility, decentralized

**Real Example:**
Bitcoin at $30,000:
- Buy 0.1 BTC = $3,000 investment
- If BTC goes to $40,000: You make $1,000 profit
- If BTC drops to $20,000: You lose $1,000

Technical analysis studies price charts and trading volume to predict future price movements. It's based on the idea that market psychology repeats itself.

**Key Concepts:**
‚Ä¢ **Support**: Price level where buying interest is strong
‚Ä¢ **Resistance**: Price level where selling pressure is strong
‚Ä¢ **Trend**: Overall direction of price movement
‚Ä¢ **Volume**: Number of shares traded

**Essential Indicators:**

**1. Moving Averages** üìà
- **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**: Average price over time period
- **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Gives more weight to recent prices
- **Golden Cross**: 50-day MA crosses above 200-day MA (bullish)
- **Death Cross**: 50-day MA crosses below 200-day MA (bearish)

**2. RSI (Relative Strength Index)** ‚öñÔ∏è
- Measures if stock is overbought (>70) or oversold (<30)
- Helps identify potential reversal points
- Values between 0-100

**3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** üîÑ
- Shows relationship between two moving averages
- Signal line crossovers indicate buy/sell signals
- Histogram shows momentum changes

**Real Example:**
AAPL stock analysis:
- Price breaks above $150 resistance = Bullish signal
- RSI at 75 = Overbought, expect pullback
- MACD line crosses above signal = Buy signal
- Volume increases on breakout = Confirms strength

**Chart Patterns:**
üìà **Head and Shoulders**: Reversal pattern
üìä **Double Top/Bottom**: Reversal signals
üî∫ **Triangles**: Continuation patterns
üìã **Flags and Pennants**: Short-term continuations

**Pro Tips:**
‚úÖ Always use multiple indicators for confirmation
‚úÖ Consider market context and news events

Fundamental analysis evaluates a company's intrinsic value by examining financial statements, industry conditions, and economic factors.

- **PEG Ratio**: P/E √∑ Growth Rate (better than P/E alone)
- **P/B Ratio**: Price-to-Book Value
- **P/S Ratio**: Price-to-Sales

**2. Profitability Metrics** üìä
- **ROE (Return on Equity)**: Net Income √∑ Shareholder Equity
- **ROA (Return on Assets)**: Net Income √∑ Total Assets
- **Gross Margin**: (Revenue - COGS) √∑ Revenue

Portfolio management is the art of combining different investments to achieve your financial goals while managing risk.

**Core Portfolio Principles:**

**1. Asset Allocation** üéØ
- **Stocks**: Growth potential, higher risk
- **Bonds**: Income generation, lower risk
- **Cash**: Liquidity and safety
- **Alternative Assets**: Real estate, commodities, crypto

**2. Diversification Strategies** üåà
- **Geographic**: US, International, Emerging Markets
- **Sector**: Technology, Healthcare, Finance, Energy
- **Market Cap**: Large-cap, Mid-cap, Small-cap
- **Style**: Growth vs Value stocks

**3. Risk Management** üõ°Ô∏è
- **Correlation**: Don't put all eggs in correlated baskets
- **Rebalancing**: Adjust allocation quarterly/annually
- **Position Sizing**: Limit individual stock exposure
- **Stop Losses**: Protect against major losses

**Portfolio Models:**

**Conservative Portfolio** (Low Risk):
- 60% Bonds, 30% Large-cap stocks, 10% Cash
- Target: Capital preservation + modest growth
- Suitable for: Near retirement, risk-averse investors

**Balanced Portfolio** (Moderate Risk):
- 50% Stocks, 40% Bonds, 10% Alternatives
- Target: Steady growth with moderate volatility
- Suitable for: Middle-aged investors, 10+ year horizon

**Aggressive Portfolio** (High Risk):
- 80% Stocks, 15% Bonds, 5% Alternatives
- Target: Maximum growth potential
- Suitable for: Young investors, long-term horizon

**Real Example:**
$100,000 Portfolio Allocation:
- **Large-cap US stocks**: $40,000 (40%)
- **International stocks**: $20,000 (20%)
- **Bonds**: $25,000 (25%)
- **Small-cap stocks**: $10,000 (10%)
- **Cash/Alternatives**: $5,000 (5%)

**Rebalancing Strategy:**
üìÖ **Quarterly Review**: Check if allocation drifted >5%
üîÑ **Rebalance**: Sell winners, buy underperformers
üìä **Tax Efficiency**: Use tax-advantaged accounts first
üí∞ **Dollar-Cost Averaging**: Regular contributions

**Performance Monitoring:**
üìà **Benchmark Comparison**: S&P 500, Total Stock Market
üìä **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
üéØ **Goal Tracking**: Are you on track for retirement?
üìã **Annual Review**: Adjust strategy based on life changes

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
‚ùå **Over-diversification**: Too many small positions
‚ùå **Under-diversification**: Concentrated in few stocks
‚ùå **Chasing Performance**: Buying last year's winners
‚ùå **Ignoring Costs**: High fees eat into returns
‚ùå **Emotional Trading**: Making decisions based on fear/greed

**Pro Tips:**
‚úÖ Start with index funds for broad market exposure
‚úÖ Gradually add individual stocks as you learn
