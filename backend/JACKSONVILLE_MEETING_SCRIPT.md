## üéØ **Meeting Objective**
**Walk into the 10/08 meeting and walk out with a commitment (or next step) toward city funding for the $1M Jacksonville Pilot.**

---

## üó£Ô∏è **10-Minute Pitch Structure**

### **A. Opening (1 minute)**

*"Good morning, I'm Marion Collins, founder of RichesReach AI ‚Äî a Jacksonville-built platform that uses AI to help residents, students, and small businesses make smarter financial decisions.*

*This pilot keeps investment right here ‚Äî in Jacksonville jobs, training, and community growth.*

*I'm here today to propose a $1M partnership that will position Jacksonville as the first city in the Southeast to use AI for community wealth building."*

**Key Points:**
- Establish local credibility
- Set the tone as partnership, not charity
- Lead with the big vision

---

### **B. The Problem (1 minute)**

*"Too many Jacksonville residents and small businesses struggle with financial planning and capital access. We're losing millions in opportunities each year simply because our people don't have the right tools or literacy.*

*Consider this: 60% of our residents lack basic financial knowledge. Small businesses can't secure funding. Students graduate without financial skills. This isn't just a social issue ‚Äî it's an economic one.*

*Every year we don't address this, Jacksonville loses potential growth, tax revenue, and community stability."*

**Key Points:**
- Make it local and specific
- Connect to economic impact
- Create urgency

---

### **C. The Solution (2 minutes)**

*"RichesReach AI delivers those tools ‚Äî AI coaching, workshops, and dashboards that make financial literacy measurable.*

*We're proposing a 12-month, $1M pilot to train residents, youth, and business owners while creating 6‚Äì10 local jobs.*

*Here's how it works:*

*First, we serve 10,000 residents with AI-powered financial coaching ‚Äî personalized budgeting, savings, and investment advice.*

*Second, we certify 1,000 youth in financial literacy and career preparation through partnerships with our schools.*

*Third, we support 300 small businesses with funding readiness and growth strategies.*

*All of this happens through our AI platform, which learns and improves as it serves more people."*

**Key Points:**
- Show the scale and scope
- Emphasize local job creation
- Demonstrate the technology advantage

---

### **D. The Impact (2 minutes)**

*"Let me show you what this means for Jacksonville."*

**[Show one-pager visuals]**

*"10,000 residents served with financial tools and education. 1,000 youth certified in financial literacy. 300 small businesses prepared for funding. 6‚Äì10 local hires with good-paying jobs.*

*But here's the real impact: 80‚Äì90% of our $1M budget stays right here in Jacksonville. We're not just spending money ‚Äî we're investing in our community.*

*The results are measurable: 40% improvement in financial literacy scores, 25% increase in savings rates, 60% of small businesses secure funding, and 200+ residents land better-paying jobs.*

*It's not just a tech project ‚Äî it's workforce development and community empowerment.*

*Jacksonville becomes the first city in the Southeast to use AI for community wealth building."*

**Key Points:**
- Use visual aids
- Emphasize local economic impact
- Show measurable outcomes
- Position Jacksonville as a leader

---

### **E. The Ask (2 minutes)**

*"We're requesting $1,000,000 to launch this pilot.*

*Here's how we'll use it: 60% goes to local jobs and platform development, 25% to training and education, and 15% to analytics and reporting.*

*We'll manage funds transparently, report quarterly, and build measurable economic outcomes.*

*But we're flexible. We can start with a $500K 6-month pilot and scale based on performance ‚Äî or co-fund through a city/private partnership.*

*What we need from you is a commitment to fund or co-fund this pilot, and city endorsement to help attract matching private capital.*

*This isn't just an investment in RichesReach AI ‚Äî it's an investment in Jacksonville's future."*

**Key Points:**
- Be specific about the ask
- Show budget transparency
- Offer flexibility
- Make it about Jacksonville's future

---

### **F. Close (2 minutes)**

*"Jacksonville can lead the Southeast as the first city to use AI for community wealth building.*

*We're ready to hire local talent and begin immediately once funding is confirmed.*

*This pilot will create jobs, improve financial literacy, and keep money circulating in our community.*

*The question isn't whether AI will transform community development ‚Äî it's whether Jacksonville will lead the transformation.*

*I've brought detailed materials for your review, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.*

*What would you like to know about this opportunity?"*

**Key Points:**
- End with the big vision
- Show readiness to execute
- Hand over materials
- Open for questions

## üß† **Questions to Expect (and How to Nail Them)**

### **"Where does the money go?"**
*"Great question. 60% goes to local jobs and platform development ‚Äî that's $600,000 creating 6-10 good-paying jobs right here in Jacksonville. 25% goes to training and education programs ‚Äî workshops, materials, and certification programs. 15% goes to analytics and reporting ‚Äî so you can see exactly what impact we're having. We're fully transparent about every dollar."*

### **"Who owns the technology?"**
*"RichesReach AI owns the technology, but Jacksonville will have full access to data dashboards and results. You'll see real-time metrics on how residents are benefiting, and you'll own the data about your community's financial health. This isn't about us ‚Äî it's about empowering Jacksonville with better insights."*

### **"What happens after 12 months?"**
*"We scale sustainably using private sponsors and paid plans. The city's seed funding kickstarts the ecosystem, and then we transition to a sustainable model. Think of it like planting a tree ‚Äî the city provides the initial investment, and then it grows and benefits the community for years to come."*

### **"How do we know it's working?"**
*"Quarterly reports with concrete metrics ‚Äî participant outcomes, financial literacy scores, job placements, and local spend. You'll see exactly how many residents we're serving, how their financial health is improving, and how much money is staying in Jacksonville. We're accountable to you and to the community."*

### **"Can we start smaller?"**
*"Absolutely. We can phase in at $250‚Äì500K and expand once KPIs are met. We could start with just the resident coaching program, or just the youth education, and grow from there. The key is getting started and proving the concept."*

### **"What's the risk?"**
*"The risk is minimal because we're a Jacksonville company with a proven track record. We're not asking you to fund an untested idea ‚Äî we're asking you to invest in a local company that's already delivering results. And if it doesn't work, we stop. But if it does work, Jacksonville becomes a model for the entire Southeast."*

### **"How is this different from other programs?"**
*"This is AI-powered, which means it's personalized and scalable. Traditional financial literacy programs are one-size-fits-all and expensive to scale. Our AI learns from each interaction and gets better over time. Plus, we're not just teaching ‚Äî we're providing ongoing coaching and support."*

### **"What about privacy and data security?"**
*"We use enterprise-grade encryption and comply with all privacy regulations. Residents control their own data, and we only share aggregate, anonymized insights with the city. We're committed to protecting privacy while delivering public value."*
