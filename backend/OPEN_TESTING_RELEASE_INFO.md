## ðŸ”§ **Alternative Build Options**

Since EAS CLI is having Node.js compatibility issues, here are your options:

### **Option 1: Use Existing APK (Recommended for Testing)**
If you have an existing APK from previous builds, you can use that for open testing:
1. Go to your EAS Build dashboard: https://expo.dev/accounts/marion205/projects/richesreach-ai/builds
2. Download the latest successful build
3. Convert APK to AAB if needed (or use APK for testing)

### **Option 2: Manual Build with Expo CLI**
```bash
cd /Users/marioncollins/RichesReach/mobile
npx expo build:android --type app-bundle
```

### **Option 3: Use Development Build**
For open testing, you can use a development build:
1. Use the existing development APK

3. This allows real users to test the app
