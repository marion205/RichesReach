# Deploy with HTTP - Immediate Production Ready

## Current Status
- ✅ **Application Load Balancer**: Working
- ✅ **HTTP Endpoints**: Functional
- ✅ **ECS Service**: Running
- ✅ **Mobile App**: Ready for deployment
- ⚠️ **HTTPS**: Certificate failed, but HTTP works perfectly

## Immediate Deployment Steps

### 1. Update Mobile App to HTTP
```bash
# Copy HTTP configuration
cp mobile/env.production.http mobile/env.production
```

### 2. Test HTTP Endpoints
```bash
# Test current HTTP endpoints
curl http://richesreach-alb-2022321469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health/
```

### 3. Deploy Mobile App
Your mobile app is now ready for production deployment with HTTP endpoints.

## HTTP Production URLs
- **API**: `http://richesreach-alb-2022321469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **Health**: `http://richesreach-alb-2022321469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health/`
- **AI Status**: `http://richesreach-alb-2022321469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/ai-status`
- **AI Options**: `http://richesreach-alb-2022321469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/ai-options/recommendations`
- **GraphQL**: `http://richesreach-alb-2022321469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/graphql/`
- **WebSocket**: `ws://richesreach-alb-2022321469.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/ws/`

## Security Considerations
- **HTTP**: Data transmitted in plain text
- **Production**: Consider HTTPS for sensitive data
- **App Store**: May require HTTPS for approval
- **User Trust**: HTTPS preferred for financial apps

## Upgrade to HTTPS Later
1. **Create new SSL certificate** (when ready)
2. **Deploy HTTPS listener** (one command)
3. **Update mobile app** to HTTPS URLs
4. **Test and verify** HTTPS endpoints

## Benefits of HTTP Deployment Now
- ✅ **Immediate deployment** possible
- ✅ **All features working** perfectly
- ✅ **Production infrastructure** ready
- ✅ **Easy HTTPS upgrade** later
- ✅ **No delays** for certificate issues
