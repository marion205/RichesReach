POST http://localhost:3001/batch-analyze
Content-Type: application/json
{
"symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"],
"include_technical": true,
"include_fundamental": true
}
```
### Personalized Recommendations
```bash
POST http://localhost:3001/recommendations

**Returns personalized stock recommendations based on user income and risk tolerance:**
- **Low Income (<$30k)**: Focus on stable, dividend-paying stocks (JNJ, PG, KO, etc.)
- **Medium Income ($30k-$75k)**: Mix of stable and growth stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, etc.)
- **Higher Income ($75k-$150k)**: Include more growth and tech stocks
- **High Income (>$150k) or No Profile**: Best the market has to offer
## Personalized Investment Criteria
The algorithm adapts recommendations based on user income and risk tolerance:
### Income-Based Stock Universe:
- **Low Income (<$30k)**: Conservative, dividend-focused stocks (JNJ, PG, KO, WMT, etc.)
- **Medium Income ($30k-$75k)**: Balanced mix of stable and growth stocks
- **Higher Income ($75k-$150k)**: More growth and technology stocks included
- **High Income (>$150k)**: Premium market opportunities and diverse sectors
### Dynamic Scoring Thresholds:
- **Low Income**: Minimum score 75 (highest standards for safety)
- **Medium Income**: Minimum score 70 (standard beginner criteria)
- **Higher Income**: Minimum score 65 (slightly more flexible)
- **High Income**: Minimum score 60 (access to more opportunities)
### Risk Tolerance Filtering:
- **Conservative**: Only Low-risk stocks
- **Moderate**: Low and Medium-risk stocks
- **Aggressive**: All risk levels considered
