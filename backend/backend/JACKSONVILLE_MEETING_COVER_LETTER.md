---

Dear City Officials,

I am writing to propose a groundbreaking partnership between **RichesReach AI** and the City of Jacksonville to launch a **$1,000,000 pilot program** that will transform financial literacy and economic opportunity for our community.

As a Jacksonville-built company, RichesReach AI has developed advanced artificial intelligence technology that delivers personalized financial coaching, real-time market analysis, and comprehensive financial education. Our platform has already proven successful in helping individuals and businesses make smarter financial decisions, and we believe Jacksonville is the perfect city to demonstrate how AI can be used for community wealth building.

## **The Opportunity**

This pilot program will directly benefit Jacksonville in multiple ways:

- **Local Job Creation**: We will hire 6-10 full-time professionals in Jacksonville
- **Community Impact**: Serve 10,000 residents with AI-powered financial coaching
- **Economic Multiplier**: 80-90% of funds will circulate within the Jacksonville economy
- **Innovation Leadership**: Position Jacksonville as the first AI-powered financial empowerment city in the Southeast
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Provide quarterly reports on participant success and community impact

## **The Problem We Solve**

Jacksonville faces significant challenges in financial literacy and economic opportunity:

- 60% of residents lack basic financial knowledge
- Small businesses struggle to secure funding and grow

- **15% ($150,000)**: Analytics, reporting, and compliance
