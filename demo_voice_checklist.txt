VOICE ASSISTANT DEMO CHECKLIST
==============================

CRITICAL: OpenAI API Key
[ ] Set OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
   → export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   → Or add to .env file: OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

Speed Optimizations (DONE):
✅ Reduced API timeouts: 2.8s → 1.5s (crypto), 3.0s → 1.5s (stocks)
✅ Reduced LLM max_tokens: 120 → 80 (faster generation)
✅ Reduced LLM temperature: 0.6 → 0.5 (more deterministic)
✅ Real data fetching: get_trade_idea now uses real stock prices
✅ Parallel data fetching: Multiple prices fetched simultaneously
✅ Streaming responses: Token-by-token for instant feedback

Real Data Usage (DONE):
✅ Stock prices: Yahoo Finance API (real-time)
✅ Crypto prices: CoinGecko API (real-time)
✅ Trade ideas: Now use real current prices (not hardcoded)
✅ Force refresh: Voice queries bypass cache for fresh data

Test Before Demo:
[ ] Test voice query: "What should I buy for the next few weeks with $500?"
[ ] Verify response includes real stock price
[ ] Check response time (should be < 1 second for first token)
[ ] Test stock query: "What's Apple trading at?"
[ ] Verify real-time price is shown

Demo Queries to Practice:
1. "What should I buy for the next few weeks with about five hundred dollars?"
2. "What's Apple trading at?"
3. "What's Bitcoin's current price?"
4. "Show me a good swing trade"

Expected Response Times:
- First token (ACK): < 100ms
- First real token: < 500ms
- Full response: < 2 seconds

If OPENAI_API_KEY is not set:
- Voice transcription will use mock data
- AI responses will be generic/fallback
- Demo will still work but less impressive
