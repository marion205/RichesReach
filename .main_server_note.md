# IMPORTANT: Using main_server.py on this branch

This branch uses `main_server.py` as the primary backend entry point.

## Starting the Backend

Always use:
```bash
python3 main_server.py
```

Or with the startup script:
```bash
./start_backend_now.sh
```

## Key Points

- `main_server.py` is the production-ready backend server
- All GraphQL, REST, and WebSocket endpoints are served from this file
- Socket.io is integrated for real-time features
- All advanced AI features (voice, Oracle, Daily Digest, etc.) are implemented here

## Do NOT use:
- `deployment_package/backend/main.py` (this is for deployment package only)
- Any other server files

This ensures consistency and that all features work correctly.
